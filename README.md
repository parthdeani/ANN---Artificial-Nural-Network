# ANN---Artificial-Nural-Network
ðŸ”¹  ANN-1.ipynb
This file builds a basic artificial neural network (ANN) to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset, which contains grayscale images of clothing items (like shirts, shoes, etc.). The key steps are:

It loads the dataset and prepares it by normalizing the pixel values.

The model has three layers: an input layer to flatten the image, a hidden layer to learn patterns, and an output layer to predict one of the 10 clothing categories.

The model is trained on the training data for a few cycles (epochs).

Finally, the model is tested on new images to check how accurately it predicts.
