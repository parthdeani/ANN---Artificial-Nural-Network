# ANN---Artificial-Nural-Network
ðŸ”¹  ANN-1.ipynb

This file builds a basic artificial neural network (ANN) to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset, which contains grayscale images of clothing items (like shirts, shoes, etc.). The key steps are:

It loads the dataset and prepares it by normalizing the pixel values.

The model has three layers: an input layer to flatten the image, a hidden layer to learn patterns, and an output layer to predict one of the 10 clothing categories.

The model is trained on the training data for a few cycles (epochs).

Finally, the model is tested on new images to check how accurately it predicts.

This file builds upon the previous model and includes performance analysis and visualization:

After training the model, it uses prediction results to analyze how well the model performed.

It calculates accuracy and also uses tools like confusion matrix and classification report to give a detailed view of where the model is getting confused.

It shows which images were predicted incorrectly by the model and compares the wrong predictions with the actual correct labels.

This helps understand the modelâ€™s strengths and weaknesses more clearly.
